      "The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , which was caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has posed tremendous challenges to the international communities [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .As of March 18, 2020 , there were 81,116 confirmed cases and 3231 deaths in China 9 ; Globally, 160 counties and territories have reported cases of COVID-19, including 191,127 confirmed cases and 7807 deaths 9 . In response to \"the alarming levels of spread and severity\", the World Health Organization (WHO) has characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic 10 . This is the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus. Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of RNA viruses that cause a variety of mild and severe diseases in humans and animals 11 . Prior to the COVID-19, there were two severe outbreaks of human coronavirus diseases in the past two decades, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Super-spreading events, by which an individual patient spread an infection to a large number of susceptible people, were associated with the outbreaks of SARS and MERS [19] [20] [21] [22] . While case clusters with human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported [3] [4] [5] [23] [24] [25] , it remains unknown whether super-spreading events occurred in the outbreak of COVID-19. Here, we conducted a retrospective study and identified a super-spreading chain of transmission associated with COVID-19.This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (No. WDRY2020-K019). Oral consent was obtained from the patients or their family members, whereas written informed consent was waived by the Provincial and National Health Commissions in China under the exceptional circumstances for investigation of an ongoing disease outbreak. In this cohort, we identified a super-spreading chain of transmission involving 52 linked patients with COVID-19 in three .

The data we retrieved from the electronic medical records included demographic features, comorbidities, clinical presentation, laboratory investigation, RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2, serum specific IgM and IgG antibodies, chest computed tomographic (CT) scan, and the disease outcome. The contact and exposure history were also collected through communications with the patients and/or their family members. or Fisher's exact test. A two-sided α of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Statistical analyses were done using the SPSS 22.0 software.In this report, we conducted a retrospective study and identified a super-spreading chain of transmission involving the index patient, seven cancer patients, 40 health care workers and four family members ( Figure 1 and Table 1 ).Identification of the index patient (C-1). On January 3, 2020, a male patient in his 50s developed fever (38.8°C), headache, chest pain and myalgias when he visited his relative in a ward room (Ward-X in Figure 1 ) shared by four female cancer patients at Hospital A. He initially thought that he had a \"cold\" and continued to visit this ward until he was admitted to hospital B on January 10, 2020. His Chest CT-scan findings showed a rapid progression of bilateral infiltrates in the lungs ( Figure 2 ). He received antibiotics treatment for one week but was ineffective. On January 18, he was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and diagnosed with COVID-19. He died of severe respiratory failure on January 26, 2020. While the exact exposure history of this patient remained unclear, he did not visit the \"Huanan Wet Market\", the suspected origin for this outbreak in Wuhan. Of note, the \"Huanan Wet Market\" is located in the Hankou District of Wuhan city, which is separated from the Wuchang District by the Yangtse River. The two hospitals (A and B) where the index patient visited were located in Wuchang District.A super-spreading event initiated by the index patient. Eleven people presented fever and abnormal CT-scan findings after close contacts with the index patient C-1 between January 3 and January 10, 2020 ( Figure 1 and Table 1 ). Below was a timeline for the initial transmission events. (1) C-1 visited his relative C-2 in Ward-X that was shared by other three cancer patients (C-3, C4, and C-5) at the Department-I of hospital A when he first developed fever and other symptoms on January 3. All four cancer patients had close contacts with C-1 and subsequently developed fever (38°C-40°C) and abnormal CT-scan findings between January 4 and January 15.All were RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2, but the assays for the serum specific antibodieswere not available at that time. All four patients did not have other exposure records and epidemiological history before their disease onsets. Three of them died of severe respiratory .

C-2 developed symptoms on January 9 (6 days after the onset of C-1) and died on January 17. C-3 developed symptoms on January 4 (one day after her close contact with C-1) and died on January 24. C-4 developed symptoms on January 15 and transferred to a designated hospital on January 30, where she remained at a stable condition after the treatment. C-5 developed symptoms on January 15 and died on January 29.(2) On January 3, C-1 also visited the office area of the health care workers at the Department-I of hospital A to discuss the treatment plan for his relative C-2. Four doctors (C-6, C-7, C-8 and C-9) and one nurse (C-10) developed fever and abnormal CT-scan findings between January 9and January13 (within 10 days after close contacts with C-1). In addition, a cluster of eleven health care workers (C-17 to C-27) from the same department who had close contact with their co-workers (C-6 to C-10) presented fever and abnormal CT-scan findings between January 16 and January 21 (within 3-12 days after their exposure to the secondary cases). All the health care workers were previously healthy and did not have other exposure records and epidemiological history ( Figure 1 and Table 1 ).(3) On January 10, C-1 was admitted to hospital B, where he was diagnosed with COVID-19.Two doctors (C-51 and C-52) had close contacts with C-1 when they met with him on a medical consultation meeting to discuss his treatment plan. They presented fever and abnormal CT-scan findings on January 21 and January 26, respectively. Both of them were previously healthy and did not have other exposure records and epidemiological history. Our findings suggested that C-1 was the source patient and considered as a \"super-spreader\" who initiated this super-spreading chain of transmission.Between January 14 and January 20, 2020, a total of twelve doctors and nurses (C-29 to C-40) from Department-II in hospital A developed fever and abnormal CT-scan findings ( Figure 1 and Table 1 ). All twelve individuals were previously healthy, and none of them except C-29 had other exposure records and epidemiological history. C-29, a male doctor in his 50s, attended medical consultation meetings between January 3 and January 8 at the Department-I to discuss treatment plans for two lung cancer patients (C-2 and C-3). Of note, Department-I and Department-II were located at two separate buildings in hospital A. C-29 had close contact with .

All eleven co-workers (C-30 to C-40) had close contacts with C-29 before his disease onset. In addition, C-29's relative (C-41) was diagnosed with COVID-19 on January 25. Our findings indicated that C-29 was likely the source patient who was responsible for introduction of COVID-19 into this cluster, and therefore was considered as a \"super-spreader\".A cluster of tertiary cases linked to a gastric cancer patient. C-13, a female with gastric cancer, was initially hospitalized in Ward-Y at Department-I in hospital A. She was transferred to Department-III on January 10 and had surgical operation on January 12. She had close contacts with C-9 and C-10 who were in charge of her treatment at Department-I, However, she did not present fever and other symptoms until January 15 (i.e. 3 days after her surgical operation). She was transferred to a designated hospital after her confirmation with COVID-19 on January 23 and remained at a stable condition. Two Doctors (C-14 and C-15) who conducted the operation procedures were diagnosed with COVID-19 on January 21 and January 22, respectively. In addition, C-16 (C-15's relative) showed fever and other symptoms on January 23 after close contact with C-16 at home.A cluster of tertiary cases linked to a colon cancer patient. C-42, a female colon cancer patient, was admitted to the same hospital ward room (Ward-Y) as C-13 on January 10 and treated by the same medical team (C-9 and C-10). She developed fever (39.9°C) and other symptoms on January 16, and died of severe respiratory failure on January 18. She did not take CT-scan and RT-PCR testing due to her sudden death. C-43, a male doctor from Department-V examined C-42 on January 15, and was diagnosed with COVID-19 on January 23 (8 days after his close contact with C-42). Moreover, C-44 was accompanying his relative C-42 in hospital A and diagnosed with COVID-19 on January 17 (one day after the disease onset of C-42). Two doctors (C-45 and C-46) who conducted the medical treatment on C-44 at Department-V in hospital A were diagnosed with COVID-19 on January 24 and January 25, respectively. Furthermore, C-44 was transferred to hospital C on January 17. Four doctors (C-47, C-48, C-49, and C-50) at hospital C had close contacts with C-44, and developed fever and other symptoms between January 24 and January 27. Our findings also suggested that C-44 was a potential \"super-spreader\" since he transmitted the disease to six people who had direct contacts with him..

(2) C-12, a male doctor from the Department-VI, conducted medical treatment on C-4 and C-5 on January 14, and was diagnosed with COVID-19 on January 19 (5 days after direct contacts with C-4 and C-5).(3) C-28, a male liver cancer patient in his 60s (Ward-Z), was diagnosed with COVID-19 on January 20 (4 days after the disease onset of his doctor C-17) and died of respiratory failure on January 23, 2020.Clinical features and laboratory findings ( Figure 1 , Table 1 , and Table 2 ). There were 31 female and 21 male patients in this cohort, and the median age was 37 years (range: 22-79 years). None of them were linked to the \"Huanan Wet Market\", the suspected origin for this outbreak in Wuhan. Each of them, however, had a contact history with the index patient C-1 or his close contacts. Approximately 87% (45/52) of the patients had fever or other symptoms, 96%(50/52) had abnormal chest CT-scan findings, 86% of the tested patients (39/45) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the nasopharyngeal or throat swab specimen, 85% of the tested patients (29/34) were positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and/or IgG, 15% of the RT-PCR positive patients were tested negative for the specific IgM and/or IgG at the convalescent phase, and 15% of the RT-PCR negative patients were tested positive for the specific IgM and/or IgG. The severe patients experienced a significant decrease in oximetry saturation, lymphocyte, and platelet counts, along with a significant increase in C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase. Five of the seven cancer patients (71%) died within 2-20 days of the disease onset. All six fatal cases had comorbidities, whereas all the health care workers were previously heathy individuals.In this study, we identified a super-spreading chain of transmission associated with COVID-19 at the early stage of the outbreak in Wuhan. In addition, we were able to find the index patient C-1 and C-29 as the presumptive \"super-spreaders\" who initiated and amplified this chain of transmission, respectively. We understand that \"super-spreader\" is still a vague term without a strict scientific definition, we followed a definition adopted by the epidemiologists during the SARS outbreak, which defined the \"super-spreader\" as an individual with transmission of SARS .

Therefore, C-1 and C-29 were considered as the super-spreaders because each of them passed the infection of SARS-CoV-2 on to at least eleven contacts. Since super-spreading events were associated with the outbreaks of SARS and MERS [19] [20] [21] [22] , it would be not a surprise to discover super-spreading events associated with COVID-19.Our study has a number of unique features. (1) By coincidence, this transmission chain started from a hospital ward shared by four female cancer patients, and the female health care workers (total of 23) outnumbered the male co-workers (total of 17). As a result, there were 60% female (31/52) and 40% (21/52) male patients in this cohort, which were different from other reports 3-5 .(2) we were able to identify several distinct clusters of cases based on the exposed time and the date of disease onset, which helped connecting all the related activities and events. (3) There were seven cancer patients in this study, and five of them (71%) died of severe respiratory failure within 2-20 days of their disease onsets, suggesting that cancer patients were highly vulnerable to COVID-19 and had rapid disease progression and high mortality rate due to immune suppression and comorbidities. (4) Approximately 13.5% (7/52) of patients were asymptomatic individuals in this study (Table 1) 15% of the RT-PCR positive patients were tested negative for the specific IgM and/or IgG at the convalescent phase. The discrepancy between the results of the RT-PCR assay and serological testing suggested the existence of possible \"false negative\" and/or \"false positive\" with these assays. Both scenarios may significantly affect the clinical diagnosis and should be addressed accordingly by additional studies given the fact that strict clinical validation studies were not performed on any of these assays due to the urgent need for screening and diagnosis of COVID-19 during the disease outbreak. In particular, it would be a huge concern if a significant portion of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were tested negative for the specific IgM and IgG at the convalescent phase.A large number of health care workers were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in our cohort, which were consistent with a report that 41% of the 138 hospitalized patients at one of the major tertiary hospitals in Wuhan were hospital-related transmission 30 . These findings suggested that .

(1) Some cases had incomplete records of the exact exposure time and epidemiological history. (2) RT-PCR and serological testing were not carried out for some cases due to the irregular service during this outbreak. (3) The virus genomes of SARS-CoV-2 in this cohort were not were sequenced.In conclusion, we identified a super-spreading chain of nosocomial transmission that occurred in the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan. Given the fact that COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly in many other countries worldwide, it is conceivable that more super-spreading events will be identified in near future, and its impact on the disease outbreak and transmission warrant further investigation. The finding that a significant portion of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were tested negative for the specific IgM and IgG at the convalescence stage should be addressed by additional studies.We are extremely grateful to all the patients and their families for participation of this study and providing all the valuable information. We also thank our colleagues for their kind help and strong support..

      "Before the lock-down of Wuhan/Hubei/China, on January 23 rd 2020, a large number of individuals infected by COVID-19 moved from the epicenter Wuhan and the Hubei province due to the Spring Festival, resulting in an epidemic in the other provinces including the Shaanxi province. The epidemic scale in Shaanxi was comparatively small and with half of cases being imported from the epicenter. Based on the complete epidemic data including the symptom onset time and transmission chains, we calculate the control reproduction number (1.48-1.69) in Xi'an. We could also compute the time transition, for each imported or local case, from the latent, to infected, to hospitalized compartment, as well as the effective reproduction number. This calculation enables us to revise our early deterministic transmission model to a stochastic discrete epidemic model with case importation and parameterize it. Our model-based analyses reveal that the newly generated infections decay to zero quickly; the cumulative number of case-driven quarantined individuals via contact tracing stabilize at a manageable level, indicating that the intervention strategies implemented in the Shaanxi province have been effective. Risk analyses, important for the consideration of \"resumption of work\", show that a large second outbreak is expected if the level of case importation remains at the same level as between January 10 th and February 4 th 2020. However, if the case importation decreases by 30%, 60% and 90%, the second outbreak if happening will be of small-scale assuming contact tracing and quarantine/isolation remain as effective as before. Finally, we consider the effects of intermittent inflow with a Poisson distribution on the likelihood of multiple outbreaks. We believe the developed methodology and stochastic model provide an important model framework for the evaluation of revising travel restriction rules in the consideration of resuming social-economic activities while managing the disease control with potential case importation.\n",

      "Coronaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses, with a spherical shape and crown-like spines, from which their name derives. They generally cause mild respiratory infections but can sometimes be fatal. Since their first discovery and molecular characterization, three major spread out globally [2 ,6, 8, 11] , causing approximately 80,000 cases and 2,400 deaths as of February 22 nd 2020 [13] .Since January 23 rd 2020, the Chinese authorities have been implementing unprecedented and increasingly stringent public health interventions, including a complete lock-down of Wuhan and neighboring cities, strict contact tracing and travel restrictions in the epicenter and across the country [13] . Incorporating these interventions into the classical epidemic models has resulted in reliable estimates of epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 transmission in the epicenter and accurate near-casting the epidemic trend and peak time [18] [19] [20] , in comparison with other earlier modeling studies focusing on analyzing the transmission risk based on data at the early outbreak stage [1, 3, 4, 17] . One important lesson gained from our recent experience suggests the need of updating the model parameters and model setting to reflect the rapid improvement of screening, diagnosing and testing techniques/procedures, accompanied by intensive contact tracing, quarantine and isolation.The feasibility of enhancing model capacity to assess transmission risk and evaluating intervention effectiveness has also been substantially increased due to the improvement of the quality of the data, specially from other Chinese cities and provinces where the complete lock-down of major cities such as Wuhan in the Hubei province has prevented a significant portion of infection importation, so the reduction of imported cases coupled with intensive contact tracing produced some high quality data with rather complete information on symptom onset time and transmission-chain, as will be discussed in the data section below. This enhanced model capacity for near-casting is particularly important, since the gradually relaxing of the travel restriction demands proactive-and real-time assessment of the risk of a potential second outbreak in other Chinese cities. An objective of our study is to provide this assessment, and to use this assessment along with the incorporation of feasible public health interventions into our stochastic disease transmission model to suggest the scale of interventions for these cities to prevent a second outbreak. As COVID-19 spread has occurred in many regions globally, we believe our study provides an important tool to inform public health decisions regarding travel restriction and social distancing in these regions according to their public health capacity to maintain an effective contact tracing, quarantine and isolation procedure.In order to achieve the above research objectives, we examine the transmission characteristics of the COVID-19 epidemic in other areas outside Hubei province and quantify the risk of case importation into the current outbreak which is expected to end soon, and into a potential secondary outbreak due to the \"resumption of work\" in these areas. We focus on the effectiveness and implementation timeliness of prevention and control strategies, as well as the choice of timing for the \"resumption of work\" and its impact on the risk of a secondary outbreak.Our analysis is based on the complete \"tracking and recording\" information of imported cases and local cases detected in the province of Shaanxi province [7] , as this allows us to generate a data set that includes the time series of daily latent, infected and hospitalized cases. Since the outbreak scale in the Province of Shanxi was relatively small and this is subject to stochasticity in both case importation and local cases generated by the importation and since the Provincial data has detailed information on symptom onset and serial intervals, we adopt a method developed by Nishiura and Chowell [15, 16] to estimate the effective reproduction number, and we revise some of our early deterministic models to a novel discrete stochastic model to address the key issues relevant to preventing a secondary outbreak of COVID-19 in other provinces except for Hubei, due to the anticipated gradually relaxing of travel restriction and returning to normal social and economic activities.We obtained the data of laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCov cases in Shaanxi province from the \"National Health Commission\" of the People's Republic of China and the \"Health Commission\" of the Shaanxi Province [7, 13] . It is worth mentioning that very detailed data information for each confirmed case has been released. This strict contact tracing strategy gave detailed information of illness onset, the first medical visit, quarantined period and confirmation. Then the data do not only include numbers, such as the number of newly reported cases, the cumulative number of reported confirmed cases, the cumulative number of cured cases and the number of death cases, and the cumulative numbers of quarantined and suspected cases (shown in Figure 1(A) ), but also include the information such as the dates of illness onset, first medical visit, isolation, laboratory confirmation and discharge, and/or date of coming into Shaanxi (for imported cases). The data were released and analyzed anonymously.Based on the recorded information, we can get the daily number of latent, infected and hospitalized individuals, and we call these data sets as traced data, as shown in Figure 1 (A-C).Note that that daily number of hospitalized cases means the first medical visit and then being quarantined rather than daily number of confirmed cases. Further, we collect the data of population mobility from the website of Baidu Qianxi (http://qianxi.baidu.com). It contains the trend of inflow of population to Shaanxi before the 2020 Spring Festival and after 2019 Spring Festival, as shown in Figure 2 (B).and be the number of newly imported cases and the number of newly confirmed imported cases on day t in Shaanxi province.represents the duration from importation to confirmation for imported cases. For k consecutive days j = 1 , … , , is assumed to follow the Poisson distribution with mean (that has to be estimated). Given the daily number of newly confirmed imported cases 1 , … , on m consecutive days 1 , … , and the probability = ( − ≤ < − + 1) that an imported case entered Shaanxi province on day j and was confirmed on day i. We assume that for each j, = ∑ =max { , 1 } is positive. Then parameters 1 , … , can be estimated by 1 , … , and through deconvolution method.We use the Richardson-Lucy iterative algorithm [5] to solve this problem. The procedure is iterative according to the following formulas:where ( ) and ( ) are fitted values of and in the n-th iteration respectively. We stop the iteration when the error of fittingbecomes small and the value of 1 ( ) , … , ( ) are reasonable. Because the method above requires that = ∑ =max { , 1 } is positive, which means that at least some fraction of imported cases who entered Shaanxi province on day j would be confirmed during the period 1 , … , , we then can determine the proper 1 and 2 such that > 0 for 1 ≤ ≤ 2 in terms of the distribution of . By using the same method, given the daily number of confirmed local cases and the probability distribution of the duration from infection to confirmation for local cases, we can also estimate the daily number of newly infected local cases on day t during some time period.To estimate the effective reproduction number ( ), we make an adaptation of the method in [15, 16] to allow for imported cases. With the same notations and assumptions above, for ( ) we haveis the discretized distribution of the serial interval with G(τ) being the cumulative distribution function. Let ℎ be the duration from importation of a primary imported case to infection of the secondary local case, ℎ = H( ) − H(τ − 1) is the discretized distribution of ℎ with H( ) being the cumulative distribution function.On the basis of the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures we stratify the populations as susceptible ( ), exposed ( ), infected ( ), hospitalized ( ), recovered ( ) compartments, the quarantined susceptible ( ) and quarantined suspected individuals ( ). The flow diagram is shown in Figure 3 . Note that here the model framework extends the model structure in our previous study by including the quarantined suspected compartment [18] [19] [20] , which consists of exposed infectious individuals resulting from contact tracing and individuals with influenza like illness and common fever needing clinical medication. The deterministic model is replaced by a discrete system with stochastic importation since the case numbers are relatively small with most of the early cases being imported in Shaanxi province [10, 12] . This modelling approach can well describe demographic stochasticity. The where the random variables in (1) can be defined by binomial Bin(n, p) distributions as follows [10, 12] : Let constant m be the transition rate from susceptible class to the suspected compartment via general clinical medication due to fever or illness-like symptoms. The suspected individuals leave this compartment at a rate of , with a proportion, f , if has been confirmed to be infected by the COVID-19, going to the hospitalized compartment, whilst the other proportion, 1-f , has been proven to be not infected by the COVID-19 and goes back to the susceptible class once recovery.Let the transmission probability be β and the contact rate be c. With contact tracing, we assume a proportion, q, of individuals exposed to the virus is quarantined, and can either move to the compartment B or S q at a rate of βcq or (1 -β)cq), depending on whether they are infected or not, while the other proportion, 1 -q, consists of individuals exposed to the virus who are missed from contact tracing and move to the exposed compartment E at a rate of βc(1 − q)once infected or stay in compartment S otherwise. All definitions of variables and parameters have been listed in Table 1 .The imported latent, infected and suspected and hospitalized cases for each day can be Since the implementation of the lock-down strategy in Wuhan on January 23 rd 2020, the prevention strategies in other parts of mainland China have been continuously strengthened. In order to truly describe the constantly strengthening of control strategies, we should consider the contact rate, quarantine rate, diagnosis rate and cure rate as the functions of time t. In this model, we assume that the contact rate c(t) is a decreasing function with respect to time t, given bywhere c 0 denotes the baseline contact rate at the initial time (i.e. before January 23 rd , 2020) with c(0) = c 0 , c b denotes the minimum contact rate under the current control strategies with lim t→∞ c(t) = c b , where c b < c 0 , and r 1 denotes the exponential decreasing rate in the contact rate.Similarly, to characterize the enhanced contact tracing we define ( ) as an increasing function with respect to time t, written as ( ) = � 0 , before Jan 23nd ,2020where 0 is the initial quarantined rate of exposed individuals with (0) = 0 = 0 in Shaanxi All rights reserved.

We also set the transition rate ( ) as an increasing function with respect to time t, thus the detection period 1/ ( ) is a decreasing function of t with the following form:, before Jan 23nd ,2020where δ I0 is the initial rate of confirmation, is the fastest confirmation rate, and 3 is the exponential decreasing rate of the detection period. Definitely, (0) = 0 and lim →∞ ( ) = with > 0 . Let be the time point at which stringent control measures are introduced on Jan 23nd, 2020. Until February 4 th 2020, there was no cured case in Shaanxi province, so the cure rate should be zero before February 4 th 2020. The number of discharged patients has increased rapidly since February 7 th 2020. Therefore, the cure rate is defined as a constant piecewise function based on the real situation.When simulating the resumption of work, we assume that the movement trend of Shaanxi p � H may reduce 30% , 60% and even 90% corresponding to weaker and weaker epidemic.From the detailed description about traced data, we can know when and what is the state of each infected person and obtain the number of who are in latent (or quarantined latent), infected and hospitalized classes, as shown in Figure 1 , which shows the evolution process of the epidemic in Shaanxi province. Figure 1 (A) gives both newly reported cases and new cases from traced data, and comparison of two time series indicates that the new cases from traced data is about 7 days ahead of the reported cases data. In particular, Figure 1 (B) and (C) give the epidemic status of cases confirmed before February 7 th and 15 th , respectively. Note that although Shaanxi province began to release the case numbers on January 23 rd , 2020, the first imported latent case came to Shaanxi as early as January 10 th , 2020, and the majority of imported cases were latent and came into Shaanxi before the end of January, 2020, as shown in Figure 2 (A). Figure2(B) shows the correlation between the total imported cases and the number of population flow into the Shaanxi province, from which we calculate the proportion of those inflows that are infected.We can also illustrate the spatial distribution of imported cases (circles) and local cases (squares) and disease evolution based on the traced data. It follows from Figure 4 that most cases are inXi'an city, few cases are in the northern part of Shaanxi while relatively many cases are in the southern part of Shaanxi, which is adjacent to Hubei province. Therefore, we can estimate the impact of population migration on the epidemic situation in the neighboring areas of Hubei Figure 7 (A). It is interesting to note that we can get the part of new infections before February 12 th , 2020 from the recoded traced data in Shaanxi province, shown in Figure 7 (B). It shows that the estimated new infections agree well with the traced data in terms of trend. We note that for some cases, their information is not complete, only the dates of illness onset or first medical visit are recorded, and hence they cannot be considered as new infections at certain dates. That is why the real new infections from traced data are less than the estimated ones, shown in Figure 7 (B).To estimate the effective reproduction number we let the distribution of serial interval be chosen as gamma distribution with mean of 7.5 days and standard deviation of 3.4 days [4, 11] .Because the distribution of the duration from importation of a primary imported case to infection of the secondary local case ℎ is unknown, we initially set ℎ be equal to and then estimate the effective reproduction number R(t), as shown in Figure 7 (C). It shows the effective reproduction number started to decline on January 23 rd , 2020 when the prediction and control strategies was strengthened, was less than 1 since around January 27 th , 2020, and stabilized at almost 0 recently, which means few new infections occur. In order to investigate the variation of the effective reproduction number with ℎ varies, sensitivity analysis was carried out by changing the mean of ℎ from 1 to 7 days, as shown in Figure 7 (D). It shows that the more the mean of ℎ , the greater duration of the R(t) being greater than 1 and the earlier the R(t) exceeds the unity.All rights reserved.

Consequently, we investigate the effect of population movement on infections, especially on the possibility of inducing the second outbreak. To this end, we initially estimate the unknown parameters by least square methods, listed in Table 1 , by fitting the discrete stochastic model to the traced data between January 10 th to February 7 th (purple curve with dots), and by using the mean parameter values of 1000 times of least square estimations (listed in Table 1 ) we get 500 stochastic trajectories of model (1), as shown in Figure 8 (A-C). To investigate the effect of resumption of work on the epidemic, especially on possible second outbreak, by which we may suggest the public health sectors when workers can return back to Shaanxi, we predicate the disease infection by using the data on imported cases and moving from other cities to Shaanxi province (shown in Figure 2 ). Suppose population to start to return back to Shannxi province from February 24 th to March 9 th , 2020, we can see from Figure 9 the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027615 doi: medRxiv preprintShaanxi province is located northwest of China, adjacent to Hubei in the south. Therefore, except for Xi'an city, the capital of Shaanxi, many confirmed cases are in the southern part of Shaanxi province. It is interesting to note that Health Commission of Shaanxi Province released the case number every day with very detailed information, by which we can know when and who infected whom. Then except for the new reported (or cumulative) number of confirmed cases, we can get the daily number of individuals who are in latent (or quarantined latent), infected and hospitalized compartments, which gives the evolution process of the epidemic in Shaanxi province. We can get the durations from illness onset to the first medical visit, to the hospitalization, and to confirmation of the case. These durations are relatively smaller than those for mainland China or Hubei province [3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17] , which implies that the control measures implemented in Shaanxi are timely and medical resources are relatively sufficient.From the detailed data description, we can obtain the transmission chains over the time, which enable to calculate the control reproduction number under the implementation of stringent control strategies. The mean control reproduction number ranges from 1.48 to 1.69, and the distribution of these chains agrees well with the effective reproduction number. Note that the effective number has been declining, and is less than unity since January 27 th 2020. Recently it has stabilized at almost zero, meaning that no new infections occur, which seem to be in line with real data, as shown in Figures 1 and 7 [7] .In this study we extend our deterministic model framework [9, [18] [19] [20] ] to a discrete system incorporating stochastic modeling of imported cases to represent the relatively small number of cases observed in the Shaanxi province, with about half of them being imported cases. It is worth noting that traced data is around 7 days ahead of the reported ones, as illustrated in Figure 1 (A).Moreover, detailed data records revealed that the time interval between the first visit to a doctor and confirmation was longer, with a median of around 4 days. Then, the number of reported cases is not suitable to identify the model or estimate the parameters due to delays such as report delay, confirmation delay, etc. Therefore, it is not accurate to associate the number of confirmed cases with the number of cases in hospital, which may seriously overestimate the scale of the epidemic. Therefore, the multiple traced data sets have been employed to identify the proposed discrete stochastic model and estimate the unknown parameters in this work. Consequently, we use the number of individuals in E, I, and H classes form traced data rather than the newly (or cumulative) reported number to parameterize the model.We investigate the impact of population movement (resumption of work) on the potential second outbreak by using movement data from other cities to Shaanxi province.

The greater the proportion of imported cases the larger the second outbreak has. Furthermore, intermittent importation may induce one further outbreak episode but with small peak values.From our study, we can conclude that it is very important to study the epidemic situation of COVID-19 by using data from contact tracing rather than simply using the number of confirmed cases, especially in the areas where the imported cases are the main source of infection. This can not only provide important data information for the accurate evaluation of the epidemic situation in other areas outside Hubei Province, but also provide important and accurate data supporting the evaluation of the effectiveness and timeliness of public health intervention strategies in different areas.In the present investigation, we devised a stochastic model that can be used as an important model framework and methodology for the evaluation of imported cases on local epidemic in the Shaanxi province or other similar provinces. From the data analysis, it seems that the stringent public health interventions adopted by the Chinese authorities are effective in controlling the infection. According to data from contact tracing, the first imported cases in the Shaanxi Province occurred earlier than January 10 th 2020, and most of the imported cases were imported to the Shaanxi Province before the implementation of the national travel restrictions on January 23 rd 2020. Therefore, the earlier the implementation of the travel restrictions, the greater the reduction of infected cases by COVID-19 in the Shaanxi province has. An intermittent population inflow with low proportion of imported cases may significantly mitigate the transmission risk. Thus, if the public health authorities can strictly monitor and reduce the number of imported cases, it would be possible for the Shaanxi province to return back and resume working continuously.It is very important to study the epidemic situation of COVID-19 by using traced data rather than simply using the number of confirmed cases, especially in the areas where the imported cases are the main and the epidemic situation is not serious. This can not only provide important data information for the accurate evaluation of the epidemic situation in other areas outside HubeiProvince, but also provide important and accurate data support for the evaluation of the effectiveness and timeliness of public health intervention strategies in different areas.We proposed a stochastic model which can provide an important model framework and methodology for the evaluation of imported cases on local epidemic in the Shaanxi province (and can eventually be adapted for other similar provinces of China). Data analysis reveals that strengthening the public health interventions, tracing imported cases and improving the confirmation rate are effective and timely after January 23 rd 2020. According to the traced data shown in Figure 1 , the first imported cases in Shaanxi Province were earlier than January 10, and most of the imported cases were imported to Shaanxi Province before the national travel restrictions were implemented on January 23nd, as shown in Figure 2 . Therefore, the earlier implementation of travel restriction will greatly reduce the epidemic situation of COVID-19 in Shaanxi province, which was not serious.The findings suggest that keeping an intermittent population inflow with a low proportion of imported cases may induce a small second outbreak and hence decrease the transmission risk.Thus, if we can strictly monitor and reduce the number of imported cases, it is possible for Shaanxi to resume work continuously, especially intermittently. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027615 doi: medRxiv preprint the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027615 doi: medRxiv preprint Figure 3 .
